# Mars-Project-2021
This project aims to find the best places to establish a new civilization on Mars based on the user's conditions.
Here is an explaination on what this project is for and how to use the data and the code we have uplowded. 

First of all, like said above, this project will allow the user to find the best places, based on his conditions, to establish a new civilization on Mars. This project 
combines knowledge on Python programming and ARCGIS sofware. 
The user is able to specify conditions on four parameters we have chosen to be relevant for the purpose of this project : 
- Elevation 
- Temperature
- Ice consitency 
- Luminosity intensity 

The elavation parameter allows the user to choose wether he wants to live in an area with high altitude variations  or in an area with low altitude variations. 

The temperature parameter allows the user to choose a temperature range that is convinient for him to live on Mars. 

The ice consitency parameter allows the user to choose an area with either a high probability of ice pn the subsurface or a low probability of ice on the subsurface. 

The luminosity intensity parameter allows the user to choose a sun angle range that is convinient for him to live on Mars. The value of the sun angle is directly linked to
the luminosity intensity (the higher the value of the sun angle, the highest luminosity intensity).
